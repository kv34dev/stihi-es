# Stihi.es

Stihi.es is a small website born out of my love for poetry. I’ve gathered here some of my favorite poets — those whose words have touched my soul.

The site features pages dedicated to each author, from timeless classics to modern voices. It’s designed with a minimalist, Apple-inspired “liquid glass” aesthetic, keeping the focus purely on the poetry.

The project was inspired by [stihi.ru](https://stihi.ru/) — a well-known Russian poetry website where the original works can be found.

Stihi.es is my personal interpretation of that idea — a more intimate, refined space dedicated to the poets I love.

The project is still under development, with new poets and pages being added over time. You can explore the website through the link in the About section.
